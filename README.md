# Lyst Front End Engineering Test

We have over 800 stores on Lyst, and we want to help users find ones they are interested in quickly and easily. Your task is to finish the implementation of the autocomplete functionality of the page.

### Getting started

To get started make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and then from the project root run:

```
$ npm install
```

Once that is complete run:

```
$ npm start
```

If you go to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser you should see the a page with a text input in the middle. If you see this you are good to go. Any changes made to source files will trigger a re-build.

### Tasks

* Address the TODO comments in [autocomplete.js](src/js/modules/autocomplete.js)
* Address the TODO comments in [autocomplete.less](src/css/modules/autocomplete.less)

### Notes

* You may use any JS library that can be installed via npm, if you do then make sure you install it with the `--save` flag so that is added to the package.json file.
* Please use ES2015 (ES6) syntax wherever possible and in lieu of a formal style guide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.
* Please feel free to explain any design decisions in comments in the code, but do not feel obliged to comment every line of code.

## Submitting
Create a zip file by running the following command from the root of the project and then email it your contact at Lyst.

```
$ zip -r lyst-technical-test.zip . -x@.gitignore
```
